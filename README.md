# Description
My intention going into this project was to code the sounds and parts of several instruments in Villager - Blind Eye,
then trigger them sequentially using OTF (On-The-Fly) commands in order to perform a loose cover of the song.
To make performance easier, I named my files with numbers so they could be typed quickly. I also wrote
for-loops imitating FX automation, which I could comment out before calling a file if I wanted to bypass them.
I then experimented with OTF until I developed a performance sequence, which I rehearsed in order to get the timing right.
