# Villager - Blind Eye (ChucK Remake)
This remake was created by resynthesizing and reprogramming each part by ear in [ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/), then arranging parts on the command line to mimic the original song’s form. The latter was done through ChucK’s [On-The-Fly](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/program/otfp.html) commands, which allow one to add, remove, or replace several simultaneously running ChucK files. Each file itself utilizes modular programming: separate functions for defining signal flow, updating filters, and playing notes. Before some files are called, parts of the code are either bypassed or enabled, imitating the automation of parts in the original. [Here](https://youtu.be/AF1rxgrc_jc) is a performance of the remake, done using the terminal windows in VS Code.
